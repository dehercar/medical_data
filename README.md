# Medical Data Visualizer

These modules were developed to perform data analysis over a dataset of 70k patients. Variables like blood preasure, height, weigth, patologies, etc were examinated on them.

By analyzing demographic, medical and habits data we want to determine if they can lead into a cardio disease.

For instance, we can look at the catplot.png image and see that "overweight" is the variable most related with having a cardio disease.

The heatmap is under maintainance.
